# Running search-tweets-python in R
A code sample that allows you to run the [Search Tweets Python](https://github.com/twitterdev/search-tweets-python) wrapper in R using the package [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/). This code was created by [Jessica Garson](https://twitter.com/jessicagarson) using [R Studio](https://rstudio.com/). There is a [blog post](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tips/2020/running-the-python-package-for-search-tweets-in-r.html) to accompany this code which walks you through how this was created.


For this code to run you will need to set up a configuration file with your secrets, a sample of this can be found under `secret.yaml`. Be sure to add your `secret.yaml` to your `.gitignore` and check out [our guide on securing keys and tokens](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/securing-keys-and-tokens).
